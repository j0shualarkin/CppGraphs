# C++ Graphs
This is a simple Graph library, built as an exercise in programming with C++.

The graphs are weighted and undirected; implemented as an unordered map between strings and linked-lists.

The linked-lists are made up of "Vertex" which are structure holding a string, integer, and pointer to next "Vertex" in the list.
